## I am Ananthu T Mani. Welcome to my humble abode!

I am a fullstack web developer 🕸, part-time writer 🖋 with one
completed book 📖, and the Secretary 🤵 of the IEEE PES SBC 🌍 of
Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology, Kochi. As of now,
I am pursuing my final year of Electrical and Electronics
Engineering 👷‍♂️ ⚡.

I am a very organized person by nature. I keep my grades 💯 in a
desirable range and try to attend as many extracurricular, yet
professionally relevant activities as possible in the free time I
get. "Be efficient in whatever you do" and "Every cloud ⛅ has a
silver lining" are the two prime mottos of my lifestyle.
