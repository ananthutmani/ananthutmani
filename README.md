## Welcome to my humble abode!

Now that you're here, let's get to know each other better! <br><br>
My Name is Ananthu T Mani.<br><br>
I'm a full-stack web developer 🕸, part-time writer 🖋 with one
completed book 📖, and the Secretary 🤵 of the IEEE PES SBC 🌍 of Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology, Kochi. As of now,
I am pursuing my final year of Electrical and Electronics Engineering 👷‍♂️ ⚡.

My way of life has turned me into a very organized person. I keep my grades 💯 in a desirable range and try to attend as many extracurricular, yet
professionally relevant activities as possible in the free time I get. "Be efficient in whatever you do" and "Every cloud ⛅ has a
silver lining" are the two prime mottos of my lifestyle.
